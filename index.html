          <p>As our components start to come in, we are currently in the process of setting up low level controllers and testing them using New Eagle's Rapid Prototyping product suite. In this GIF you can see using Raptor Cal we are spoofing the throttle using a poorman's DAC,i.e a RC low pass filter on a PWM signal. We are reading the engine speed that is published on the CAN bus. Now the next steps are to assemble the generators and battery and to test our energy management strategy. Stay Tuned!</p>

                <h2>Safe Mode Motion Controller for a Tracked Vehicle</h2>
                <p>Working under the VIPR-GS research group at Clemson University, I was tasked with creating a motion controller that allows for precise control in lateral and longitudnal direction.</p>
                <p> To achieve this, a sensitivity gain was added to the joystick inputs. The inputs were then converted into left and right track velocities. This was transformed into longitudnal velocity and yaw rate which was then fed into a PID controller after rate limiting. </p>
                <p> In order to achieve fast response times we made use of a feedforward with a sigmoid function to overcome stiction at zero velocities.</p>

                  <h2>Hardware in Loop Testing of an Electric Motor</h2>
                  <p>As part of a group project, I created a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench for the Curtis AC-09 electric motor capable of simulating any drive cycle for a golf cart-type electric vehicle. This was accomplished using a dSPACE microAutoBox controller in conjunction with a Curtis 1314 programmer.</p>
                  <p>Two Curtis AC-09 motors were mechanically coupled: one operated in torque mode, applying torque based on road load calculations for the vehicle, while the other operated in speed mode to ensure that the desired speed, as per the drive cycle, was maintained. We utilized a 48V battery setup, through which one motor was drawing power and regenerating it back through the other motor, accounting for efficiency losses.</p>

                <h2>Model Predictive Controller for an Electrically Assisted Turbocharger</h2>
                <p>As part of a collaborative group project focused on optimizing engine performance, we developed a model predictive controller using Simulink. Our approach involved creating a simple forward Euler model to accurately describe the behavior of a turbocharged engine. Additionally, we integrated a motor torque add/subtract feature on the turbocharger shaft, leveraging the assumption that the electric motor's dynamics are significantly faster than the air path dynamics.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, we rigorously tested this controller using MATLAB's reference Simulink vehicle model and achieved satisfactory results. Our utilization of the forward discrete Euler method played a pivotal role in reducing the time required to find an optimized solution, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.</p>               
                <p>During our optimization process, we encountered challenges such as local minima when using MATLAB's fmincon function. To address this issue, we implemented a particle swarm search prior to initiating the fmincon algorithm. This additional step proved instrumental in mitigating the occurrence of local minima and improving the overall optimization process.</p>

                <h2>Microgrid Planning Under Uncertainties Using Scenario MPC</h2>
                <p>Microgrids have shown promise to curb disturbances to the main power grid or allow smaller hard communities to operate islanded from the main grid, thereby increasing the quality of life for the inhabitants. However, control of the microgrid has proven to be a challenging task in either scenario. Due to their much smaller inertia, microgrids are much more susceptible to power fluctuations within the grid. This has not stopped people from trying to develop controllers that can still operate these grids in an optimal manner.</p>
                <p>In this work, we present a scenario-based stochastic model predictive control algorithm to plan the grid operating set points over a 24-hour window. Our model guarantees constraint satisfaction with a probability of 70%. This limitation is attributed to time and computational constraints and could potentially be improved with more powerful computing resources. Additionally, we demonstrate that by simply tuning two parameters in the cost function, we can shift the grid from net deficit to net surplus for the case of an islanded grid with no fallback supply.</p>

              <h2>Formula SAE</h2>
              <p>Being a huge motorsports enthusiast and looking to learn more about how to be a powertrain engineer, I quickly jumped on the opportunity of joining my university's Formula SAE (FSAE) team in my junior (first) year of undergraduate studies. My work ethic was hugely influenced by FSAE, and working with people who share the same passion and a huge amount of knowledge was a brilliant experience for me.</p>
              <p>During my senior year, I led the team to switch to an electric powertrain. Along with the team, I developed the entire electric powertrain. We had to learn everything about high-voltage systems and their safety, as well as the different components required to have a working electric traction system.</p>
              <p>One major discussion point involved deciding between a 100V or 400V architecture. We stuck with a 100V architecture because of the availability of components and the lower cost.</p>
              <p>We had to build our own battery pack. We chose Samsung 30Q cells because of their power and energy density. Since we were new to the electric competition context, we decided to go with the Orion BMS2.</p>
